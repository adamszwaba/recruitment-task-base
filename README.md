# README

This is a base project built for recruitment purposes. The stack here is React, Typescript, and styled-components. Along with those, we also provide a base eslint setup for ease of use.

## Installation

First, you will need to fetch the repo from github:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/adamszwaba/recruitment-task-base.git
```

After you've cloned it, go into the project directory:

```bash
  cd recruitment-task-base
```

You will need to install dependencies via npm, the project has been stably built on **node v16.15.1**.

```bash
  npm install
```

After the packages have been installed, you can run your dev environemnt via the `dev` script:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

This will serve your app on `http://localhost:5173`.

You should also be free to use it via yarn, but the reliability of the app is up to you.
